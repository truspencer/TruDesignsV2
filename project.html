	  <h2>Welcome to My project page</h2>
		</div>
		<p>The project I chose to present is the self portrait project that was assigned towards the beginning of class and alos the gif project assigned towards the middle of the semester. In order to complete this project, I decided to choose four images that I felt really represent me and my interest. The background is of the place I want to vist most which is Tokyo, Japan. The image it self is in the Akihabara District. The second image is of Link from the Legend of Zelda. It was the first video game I ever played and is also one of my favorites. The third image is of one of my favorite K-pop bands, BTS. They represent my overall love for music no matter what genre. The last image is of Vegeta and Gohan from Dragon Ball Z, one of the first anime series I ever watched. I used them to represent my love of anime and also my love for the Abrigeded series on youtube.</p>
